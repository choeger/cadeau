<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p class="c-step">
  For a given topic, you may reuse the same slides across different presentations.
</p>

<p class="c-step">
  Doing so, you end up copying and pasting content around all over the place.
</p>

<p class="c-step">
  If you improve the content in one presentation, you are still left
  with stale content in the others.
