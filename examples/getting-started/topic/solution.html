<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p class="c-dim">
  Cadeau is called a "slide management system" because it
  separates the slide content from the prentation.
</p>

<p class="c-dim">
  The presentation file, <code>slides.yaml</code>, represents the
  outline of your presentation.
</p>

<p class="c-dim">
  It contains a list of files the represent slides <b>or groups of slides</b>.
</p>

<p class="c-dim">
  In this way, individual slides or collections of slides on a given
  topic can be managed (and version controlled) independently of the
  presentation itself.
